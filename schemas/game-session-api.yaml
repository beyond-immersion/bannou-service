  description: |
    Minimal game session management for Arcadia and other games.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support zero-copy
    WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies instead of URLs.
    See API-DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.
  version: 2.0.0

    Binding agreements between entities with milestone-based progression.

    lib-contract provides a generic system for binding agreements between entities.
    While lib-escrow handles the mechanics of holding assets during exchanges,
    lib-contract represents the ongoing obligations and rights that may result from,
    accompany, or exist independently of asset exchanges.

    **Key Design Principle**: Contracts are reactive, not proactive. External systems
    tell contracts when conditions are met/failed via API calls. Contracts store state,
    emit events, and execute prebound APIs on state transitions.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support
    zero-copy WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies.

    **Polymorphic Parties**: Any entity type can enter contracts (characters, NPCs,
    guilds, companies, governments, locations).

    **NRT Compliance**: AI agents MUST review docs/NRT-SCHEMA-RULES.md before
    modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.

  version: 2.0.0
  description: |
    Real-time communication and WebSocket connection management for Bannou services.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all service operations to support zero-copy
    WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies instead of URLs.
    See docs/BANNOU_DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.

    **Exception**: The `/connect` WebSocket endpoint uses GET/POST for the HTTP upgrade handshake,
    which is required by the WebSocket protocol specification.

    This API handles:
    - WebSocket connection establishment with JWT authentication
    - Bi-directional real-time messaging between clients and services
    - Binary protocol with message flags, channels, and service routing
    - Client reconnection and session management
    - Integration with Bannou mesh for service-to-service communication
    - Redis-backed connection state management

    ## Connection Protocol

    The connect service uses a custom binary protocol over WebSockets with the following features:

    - **Message Flags**: Control message behavior (binary, encrypted, compressed, high priority, events vs RPC)
    - **Channel System**: Support for sequential message processing on specific channels
    - **Service Routing**: Route messages to appropriate Bannou services via GUID-based service lookup
    - **Bi-directional RPC**: Services can make RPC calls back to connected clients
    - **Reconnection Support**: Clients can reconnect to existing sessions within a configurable time window

    **Schema Rules**: AI agents MUST review docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md before modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.

        Returns the capability manifest for the authenticated client's session.
        Maps client-salted GUIDs to available API endpoints based on the client's
        current permissions and session state.

        **Security**: Each client receives unique GUIDs for the same API endpoints.
        This prevents cross-session exploitation and enables per-client rate limiting.

        **Dynamic Updates**: Capabilities may change during a session when:
        - Role changes occur (admin promotion, etc.)
        - Subscription status changes
        - Session state transitions

        Clients should listen for capability update events via WebSocket to stay current.

        **Connection Flow:**
        1. Send HTTP GET request with `Connection: Upgrade` and `Upgrade: websocket` headers
        2. Include `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` header for authentication
        3. Server validates JWT and extracts user claims (roles, scopes, services)
        4. Connection upgrades to WebSocket protocol
        5. Client can send binary messages using the custom protocol

        **Reconnection:**
        For existing sessions, use `Authorization: Reconnect <reconnect_token>` instead.

        **Broadcast error codes (40-49):**
        - 40 (BroadcastNotAllowed): Broadcast attempted in External mode where it is forbidden

        **Shortcut-specific error codes (70-79):**
        - 70 (ShortcutExpired): Session shortcut has expired (TTL exceeded)
        - 71 (ShortcutTargetNotFound): Shortcut's target capability no longer available
        - 72 (ShortcutRevoked): Session shortcut was explicitly revoked

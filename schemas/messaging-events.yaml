  description: |
    Event models for Messaging service pub/sub.

    NOTE: This service provides the messaging infrastructure itself and does not
    publish or subscribe to events through standard channels.

    Debug/monitoring events (MessagePublished, SubscriptionCreated/Removed) were
    planned but never implemented. See docs/CLEANED_EVENTS.md for documentation
    of these planned events.

    **NRT Compliance**: AI agents MUST review docs/NRT-SCHEMA-RULES.md before
    modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.

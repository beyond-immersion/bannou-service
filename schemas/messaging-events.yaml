  title: Messaging Service Events
  description: |
    Event models for Messaging service pub/sub.

    NOTE: This service provides the messaging infrastructure itself and does not
    publish or subscribe to events through standard channels.

    Debug/monitoring events (MessagePublished, SubscriptionCreated/Removed) were
    planned but never implemented. See docs/CLEANED_EVENTS.md for documentation
    of these planned events.

    **Schema Rules**: AI agents MUST review docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md before
    modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.

  version: 1.0.0
  # No subscriptions - this service provides the messaging infrastructure itself
  x-event-subscriptions: []
  # No events currently implemented - debug events removed as they were aspirational
  x-event-publications: []

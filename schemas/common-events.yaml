        Published by Connect service when a WebSocket connection is fully established.
        This event ensures the RabbitMQ exchange exists before any service publishes
        to the session-specific topic (CONNECT_SESSION_{sessionId}).
        Permissions service uses this to track activeConnections and compile capabilities.

        synchronous API calls from Connect to Permissions.

        Published by Connect service when a WebSocket session is restored after reconnection.
        Services should subscribe to this event to re-publish any session shortcuts they
        previously granted, as shortcuts are cleared on disconnect and do not persist.

        **Session Shortcuts Re-publication:**
        Services that publish session shortcuts should listen for this event and re-evaluate
        whether the session should receive shortcuts again (e.g., check subscription status,
        game state, etc.) and publish new ShortcutPublishedEvents as appropriate.

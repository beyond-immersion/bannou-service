    Generic relationship management service for entity-to-entity relationships.

    This service manages relationships between ANY two entities in the system,
    not just characters. Supported entity types include characters, NPCs,
    monsters, items, locations, organizations, factions, and more.

    Key features:
    - Entity-agnostic relationship management
    - Composite uniqueness validation (entity1 + entity2 + type = unique)
    - Bidirectional relationship support
    - Type-specific metadata storage
    - Soft-delete via endedAt (relationships can be re-created after ending)

#
# STATUS: APPROXIMATE - requires verification against Reagan's exact methodology
#
# An initial extraction was performed on core-stories/output/sample-timeseries.csv.gz
# Results differ from Reagan et al. due to:
#   - Different corpus size (3,078 vs 1,327 books after filtering)
#   - Different sampling (100 vs 200 points)
#   - Unknown filtering differences
#
# The vectors below are QUALITATIVELY consistent (shapes match) but
# QUANTITATIVELY approximate. For production use, either:
#   (a) Re-run Reagan's exact methodology with identical filtering
#   (b) Obtain Reagan's published vectors if available
#   (c) Accept these as approximate templates with documented deviation

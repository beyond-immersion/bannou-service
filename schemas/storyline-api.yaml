  description: |
    Seeded narrative generation from compressed archives using the storyline SDKs.

    The Storyline service wraps `storyline-theory` and `storyline-storyteller` SDKs
    to provide HTTP endpoints for generating storyline plans from archive data.
    Plans describe narrative arcs with phases, actions, and entity requirements -
    callers (gods/regional watchers) decide whether to instantiate them.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support
    zero-copy WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies.
    See docs/BANNOU_DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

      summary: Compose a storyline plan from archive seeds
      description: |
        Generates a storyline plan using data from compressed archives and/or
        live snapshots. The plan describes phases, actions, and entity requirements
        but does NOT create any entities - callers decide whether to instantiate.

        **Workflow**:
        1. Fetch archive/snapshot data via IResourceClient
        2. Extract world state from archive bundle
        3. Select template based on goal and constraints
        4. Run GOAP planner to generate action sequences
        5. Cache plan and publish storyline.composed event

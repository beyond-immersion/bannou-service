  title: State Service Events
  description: |
    Event models for State service RabbitMQ pub/sub.

    NOTE: This is an INTERNAL service. State change events (StateChanged,
    StoreMigration, StoreHealth) were planned for debugging/auditing but never
    implemented. They would be expensive to publish for every operation.
    See docs/CLEANED_EVENTS.md for documentation of these planned events.

    **NRT Compliance**: AI agents MUST review docs/NRT-SCHEMA-RULES.md before
    modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.
  version: 1.0.0

  title: State Service Events
  description: |
    Event models for State service RabbitMQ pub/sub.

    NOTE: This is an INTERNAL service. State change events (StateChanged,
    StoreMigration, StoreHealth) were planned for debugging/auditing but never
    implemented. They would be expensive to publish for every operation.
    See docs/CLEANED_EVENTS.md for documentation of these planned events.

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

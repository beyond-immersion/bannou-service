  title: Bannou Puppetmaster Service API
  description: |
    Orchestration service for dynamic behaviors, regional watchers, and encounter coordination.
    Pulls the strings while actors perform on stage.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support zero-copy
    WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies instead of URLs.
    See docs/BANNOU_DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

  title: Bannou ServiceData Service API
  description: |
    Registry service for game services that users can subscribe to.
    Provides a minimal registry of available services (games/applications) like Arcadia, Fantasia, etc.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support zero-copy
    WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies instead of URLs.
    See API-DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.

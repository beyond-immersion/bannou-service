    Faction management as seed-based living entities (L4 GameFeatures).

    Factions are organizations whose capabilities emerge from growth, not static
    assignment. Each faction owns a seed (via lib-seed) that grows through member
    activities fed by the Collection-to-Seed pipeline. As the faction's seed grows
    through phases (nascent, established, influential, dominant), capabilities
    unlock: norm definition, enforcement tiers, territory claiming, and trade
    regulation. A nascent faction literally CANNOT enforce norms -- it hasn't grown
    enough governance capability yet.

    **Primary Purpose**: Store and serve social norms for lib-obligation.
    lib-obligation is the PRIMARY CONSUMER of faction norm data -- it queries
    this service's /faction/norm/query-applicable endpoint to resolve the full
    norm hierarchy (guild faction -> location faction -> realm baseline faction)
    into a merged norm set, then applies personality-weighted moral reasoning
    on top to produce GOAP action cost modifiers for NPC cognition. Without
    lib-faction, lib-obligation only has contractual obligations (guild charters,
    trade agreements). With lib-faction, ambient social and cultural norms
    become enforceable through the same cognition pipeline.

    **Seed Integration** (follows Gardener/Seed pattern):
    - Does NOT own seeds -- creates and grows them via lib-seed's API
    - Seed type "faction" registered at startup with growth phases and capability rules
    - Capability checks gate norm and territory endpoints
    - Implements ISeedEvolutionListener for growth/phase/capability notifications
      (DI interface for lower-to-higher communication per FOUNDATION TENETS, T27
      "DI interfaces for lower<->higher"; in-process guaranteed delivery, writes
      to distributed state for multi-node safety)

    **Collection-to-Seed Pipeline**:
    - Implements ICollectionUnlockListener to convert member activity collection entries
      into faction seed growth via tag prefix matching (governance, commerce, military)
      (DI interface for lower-to-higher communication per FOUNDATION TENETS, T27;
      in-process guaranteed delivery, writes to distributed state via lib-seed API)
    - Member activities grow the faction's seed, unlocking organizational capabilities

    **Variable Provider**:
    - Implements IVariableProviderFactory providing ${faction.*} namespace to Actor (L2)
      via the Variable Provider Factory pattern for ABML behavior expressions:
      - ${faction.is_member} -- whether character belongs to any faction (boolean)
      - ${faction.membership_count} -- number of faction memberships (integer)
      - ${faction.primary_faction} -- name of highest-role faction (string)
      - ${faction.primary_faction_phase} -- seed growth phase of primary faction (string)
      - ${faction.has_norm.<type>} -- whether any applicable norm covers a violation type (boolean)
      - ${faction.norm_penalty.<type>} -- merged base penalty for a violation type (float)
      - ${faction.in_controlled_territory} -- whether character is at a faction-controlled location (boolean)
      - ${faction.controlling_faction} -- name of controlling faction at current location (string)
      - ${faction.realm_baseline_faction} -- name of realm baseline faction (string)

    **Faction Concepts**:
    - Realm baseline faction: provides realm-wide cultural norms (honor codes, taboos)
    - Location controlling faction: provides local norms (lawless district, temple sanctity)
    - Guild factions: character memberships with role hierarchy
    - Parent/child hierarchy for organizational structure

    **Political Connections** (alliances, rivalries, treaties):
    - Inter-faction political relationships are modeled as seed bonds via lib-seed's
      existing bond API, NOT through lib-relationship. A bond between two faction
      seeds represents the alliance/rivalry as a growable entity with its own
      capability manifest (owned by ownerType: "relationship" in lib-seed).
    - Joint member activities grow the bonded seed, unlocking alliance capabilities
    - Bond strength increases with mutual activity; dissolution via seed bond API

    **Norm Resolution Hierarchy** (most specific wins):
    1. Guild faction norms (character's direct memberships)
    2. Location faction norms (controlling faction at character's current location)
    3. Realm baseline faction norms (realm-wide cultural context)

    **violationType as Opaque String**: Norm violation types (e.g., "theft", "deception",
    "violence") are opaque strings, not enums. Per SCHEMA-RULES.md "When NOT to Create
    Enums": enumerating violation types would create L4-to-L4 coupling between lib-faction
    and lib-obligation. The vocabulary is defined by contract templates and action tag
    mappings in lib-obligation; lib-faction stores whatever violation type strings callers
    provide. Adding new violation types never requires a schema change.

    **Norm Cache Invalidation**: The /faction/norm/query-applicable endpoint caches
    resolved norm sets per character+location in Redis with configurable TTL
    (FACTION_NORM_QUERY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS, default 300s). Cache entries are
    invalidated on write operations (member add/remove, norm define/update/delete,
    territory claim/release, realm baseline designation) affecting any faction in
    the resolution chain. lib-obligation can also use forceRefresh to bypass the
    cache after detecting stale data via contract lifecycle events.

    **Dependencies**:
    - lib-seed (L2) -- faction capabilities emerge from seed growth; bonds for alliances
    - lib-collection (L2) -- member activities feed faction growth via DI listener
    - lib-location (L2) -- factions control/influence locations via territory claims
    - lib-realm (L2) -- realm factions provide baseline cultural context
    - lib-contract (L1) -- formal membership agreements, guild charters
    - lib-obligation (L4, primary consumer) -- queries faction norms for NPC cognition
      cost modifiers; graceful degradation when lib-faction is disabled

    **State Store Backend Rationale**:
    - MySQL for factions, memberships, territory claims, norms: durable records
      requiring queryable indexes (by realm, game service, character, location)
    - Redis for faction cache: high-frequency reads of resolved norm sets and
      faction lookups with TTL-based expiration
    - Redis for locks: distributed lock coordination for multi-node safety

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support zero-copy
    WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies instead of URLs.
    See docs/BANNOU_DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

        Creates a new faction entity and automatically creates a seed via lib-seed
        with ownerType "faction" and the configured seed type code. The seed starts
        in the "nascent" phase with no capabilities unlocked.

        The faction code must be unique within the game service scope.

        If parentFactionId is provided, validates that the parent exists, belongs
        to the same game service and realm, and that the resulting hierarchy depth
        does not exceed the configured maximum.

        Sets a faction as the realm's baseline cultural faction. The baseline
        faction provides realm-wide default norms (honor codes, cultural taboos,
        species instincts) that apply to all characters in the realm unless
        overridden by more specific faction norms.

        Only one faction per realm can be the baseline. Setting a new baseline
        clears the previous one. The faction must belong to the specified realm.

      - Norms
      description: |
        Creates a new behavioral norm definition for a faction. Requires the
        faction's seed to have unlocked the "norm.define" capability (growth
        threshold must be reached). Higher-severity norms may require additional
        capabilities (norm.enforce.basic for Standard, norm.enforce.sanctions
        for Strict).

        Norms are stored as faction configuration and queried by lib-obligation
        for NPC cognition cost modifiers. They are NOT contract instances --
        this avoids the scaling problem of 100K NPCs each needing individual
        contract instances for ambient social rules.

        The violationType is an opaque string that maps to lib-obligation's
        violation type vocabulary (e.g., "theft", "deception", "violence",
        "honor_combat"). No separate taxonomy is maintained -- the vocabulary
        is defined by contract templates and action tag mappings.

      description: |
        Critical integration endpoint for lib-obligation. Aggregates norms from
        three resolution layers and returns a merged norm set with most-specific-wins
        resolution applied:

        1. Membership norms: from the character's faction memberships (guild norms)
        2. Territory norms: from the controlling faction at the character's location
        3. Realm baseline norms: from the realm's baseline cultural faction

        The mergedNormMap provides the winning norm for each violation type after
        resolution. When multiple layers define the same violation type, the
        most specific layer wins (membership > territory > realm baseline).

        Results are cached per character+location combination with configurable TTL.
        lib-obligation can use forceRefresh to bypass the cache after faction
        membership or location changes.

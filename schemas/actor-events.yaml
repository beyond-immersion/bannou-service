        Data representing a perception event for an actor.

        Spatial context can be provided in two ways (hybrid approach):
        1. Typed: Use the optional spatialContext field for structured spatial data
        2. Schema-less: Use perceptionType="spatial" with data containing spatial info

        The typed approach is recommended when game server has structured spatial data.
        The schema-less approach allows flexibility for game-specific spatial formats.

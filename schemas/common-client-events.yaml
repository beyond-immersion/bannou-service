  description: |
    Base schemas for server-to-client push events delivered via WebSocket.
    All client events inherit from BaseClientEvent and are routed through
    session-specific RabbitMQ channels (CONNECT_SESSION_{sessionId}).

    These events are different from service-to-service events:
    - Service events: RabbitMQ pub/sub between services via MassTransit
    - Client events: Services → RabbitMQ → Connect service → WebSocket → Client

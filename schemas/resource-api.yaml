  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Resource reference tracking and lifecycle management.

    Enables foundational services (L2) to safely delete resources by tracking
    references from higher-layer consumers (L3/L4) without violating the
    service hierarchy. Higher-layer services publish reference events when
    they create/delete references to foundational resources. This service
    maintains the reference counts and coordinates cleanup callbacks.

    **Key Design Principle**: Foundational services (L2) define what resources
    exist. This service (L1) tracks who references them. Consumers (L3/L4)
    register their references via events and define cleanup callbacks.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support
    zero-copy WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies.

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

      description: |
        Services call this at startup (OnRunningAsync) to register compression endpoints.
        When a resource is compressed, these callbacks gather data for the archive bundle.

        Mirrors the cleanup callback pattern - services register their data export
        endpoints, and compression orchestrates calling all registered callbacks to
        build a complete archive.

        after successful archival via existing cleanup callbacks.

        Flow:
        1. Get all compression callbacks for resourceType, sorted by priority
        2. If dryRun, return preview without executing
        3. Acquire distributed lock
        4. Execute each callback to gather data
        5. Bundle responses into archive (gzipped JSON per entry)
        6. Store archive in MySQL
        7. If deleteSourceData, invoke cleanup callbacks
        8. Publish resource.compressed event

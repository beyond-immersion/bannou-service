  title: Telemetry Service Events
  description: |
    Event models for Telemetry service RabbitMQ pub/sub.

    NOTE: The Telemetry service does not publish or subscribe to any events.
    It is stateless L0 infrastructure that exports traces and metrics to
    external collectors (OTLP endpoint, Prometheus). It intentionally avoids
    lib-messaging to prevent circular instrumentation concerns.

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

  title: License Service Events
  description: |
    Event subscription and publication declarations for License service.
    Lifecycle events (Created, Updated, Deleted) are auto-generated from x-lifecycle
    for both LicenseBoardTemplate and LicenseBoard entities.
    Custom events cover license unlock outcomes.

    **Event Categories**:
    - Board template lifecycle: created, updated, deleted (auto-generated)
    - Board instance lifecycle: created, deleted (auto-generated; updated omitted — boards are immutable)
    - Unlock events: license.unlocked, license.unlock-failed

    **Consumed Events**:
    - (none — cleanup is handled via x-references callbacks, not event subscriptions)

    **Topic Naming**: Uses dot-separated format (license.unlocked).

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

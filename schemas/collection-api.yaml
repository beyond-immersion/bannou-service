    Universal content unlock and archive system for collectible content.

    lib-collection (L2 GameFoundation) manages "experience, unlock, access" patterns
    for voice galleries, scene archives, bestiaries, recipe books, and any custom
    collection type. Content unlocks on first experience and becomes available for
    replay or rotation. Collection types are opaque string codes — new types can be
    added without schema changes.

    Follows the "items in inventories" pattern: entry templates define what can be
    collected, collection instances create inventory containers per owner, and
    granting an entry creates an item instance in that container. Unlike license
    (which orchestrates contracts for LP deduction and ability grants), collection
    is simpler — unlocks are direct grants without contract delegation.

    **Ownership Model**: Collections use polymorphic ownership (ownerId + ownerType),
    following the Seed pattern. Owner types are opaque strings (e.g., "account",
    "character") — NOT enums, per SCHEMA-RULES.md guidance on not enumerating
    entity types from other layers. Owner validation is caller-responsibility.

    **Key Feature**: Dynamic content selection based on unlocked entries and area
    theme configurations (weighted random from library).

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support
    zero-copy WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies.

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

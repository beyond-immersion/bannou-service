  title: Behavior Service Events
  description: |
    Event models for Behavior service RabbitMQ pub/sub via MassTransit.
    Lifecycle events are auto-generated from x-lifecycle definition.

    These events enable other services to be notified when:
    - New behaviors are compiled and stored (BehaviorCreatedEvent)
    - Existing behaviors are recompiled/updated (BehaviorUpdatedEvent)
    - Behaviors are deleted/invalidated (BehaviorDeletedEvent)

    **NRT Compliance**: AI agents MUST review docs/NRT-SCHEMA-RULES.md before
    modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.
  version: 1.0.0

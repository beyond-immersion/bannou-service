  description: |
    Realm management service for game worlds.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support zero-copy
    WebSocket routing. Path parameters are passed in request bodies instead of URLs.
    See docs/BANNOU_DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.

    Realms are the top-level persistent worlds (independent world instances).
    Each realm operates as an independent peer with distinct characteristics, species populations,
    and cultural contexts.

    **Flat Structure**: Realms have no hierarchical relationships - each is a peer world.

    **Realm Association**: Characters, species, and locations reference realms via realmId.

    **Deprecation System**: Realms can be deprecated instead of deleted directly.
    Deprecated realms remain queryable but prevent new entity creation.
    The special VOID realm serves as a sink for entities whose realm should be removed.

    **Two-Step Deletion**:
    1. Deprecate the realm (soft delete, prevents new usage)
    2. Optionally hard-delete the deprecated realm after all references are removed

    **NRT Compliance**: AI agents MUST review docs/NRT-SCHEMA-RULES.md before modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.

  title: Bannou Scene Service API
  description: |
    Hierarchical composition storage for game worlds.

    **POST-Only API Pattern**: This API uses POST for all operations to support zero-copy
    WebSocket routing. See docs/BANNOU_DESIGN.md for architectural rationale.

    The Scene service stores and retrieves hierarchical scene documents with nodes
    representing meshes, markers, volumes, emitters, and references to other scenes.

    **Core Responsibility**: Store and retrieve hierarchical scene documents.

    **Not Responsible For**:
    - Computing world transforms (consumers apply transforms themselves)
    - Determining affordances (runtime geometry concern)
    - Pushing data to other services (event-driven decoupling)
    - Interpreting node behavior (consumers decide what nodes mean)

    **SCHEMA MODIFICATION GATE**: STOP. Before modifying this schema, you MUST:
    1. Read docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md
    2. State which section applies to your change
    3. Only then proceed with edits
    Edits without stating the applicable rule are FORBIDDEN.

  title: Voice Client Events API
  description: |
    Server-to-client push events for the Voice service.
    These events notify clients of voice room state changes, peer connections,
    and tier upgrades delivered via WebSocket.

    All events inherit from BaseClientEvent (common-client-events.yaml) and use
    the "voice.{event_type}" naming convention.

    **Event Delivery**: Events are published to the session-specific RabbitMQ
    channel (CONNECT_SESSION_{sessionId}) and delivered to the client via WebSocket.

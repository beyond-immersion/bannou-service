    # === SUBSCRIBED EVENTS (from Contract) ===
    # NOTE: Contract event types (ContractMilestoneCompletedEvent, ContractFulfilledEvent,
    # ContractTerminatedEvent) are defined in contract-events.yaml and generated to
    # ContractEventsModels.cs. Do not duplicate them here - the x-event-subscriptions
    # above reference them by name and the generator resolves to the Contract namespace.

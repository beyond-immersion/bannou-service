  description: |
    Service-to-service pub/sub events for the Voice service.
    These events enable asynchronous communication between Voice service
    and other services (e.g., GameSession, Orchestrator) via RabbitMQ.

    NOTE: Voice service is currently stub-only. Event schemas are planned
    for future WebRTC/voice integration but are not yet implemented.
    See docs/CLEANED_EVENTS.md for the planned event inventory.

    **Schema Rules**: AI agents MUST review docs/reference/SCHEMA-RULES.md before
    modifying this schema. Optional reference types require `nullable: true`.

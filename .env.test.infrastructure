# CI Environment Configuration for Infrastructure Integration Tests
# This file configures the infrastructure test environment
#
# NOTE: This is a MINIMAL test configuration for validating basic infrastructure.
# It intentionally uses empty Dapr components (no pub/sub, no state store).

# Service Configuration
SERVICE_DOMAIN=ci-infrastructure-test
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
APP_LOGGING_LEVEL=Debug

# Testing Specific Configuration
SERVICES_ENABLED=false
TESTING_SERVICE_ENABLED=true

# Disable heartbeat system for infrastructure tests
# This is ONLY appropriate for minimal infrastructure testing where Dapr pub/sub
# components are intentionally not configured. All other test environments
# (HTTP tests, Edge tests, production) should have heartbeats ENABLED.

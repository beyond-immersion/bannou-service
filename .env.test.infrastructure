# CI Environment Configuration for Infrastructure Integration Tests
# This file configures the infrastructure test environment
#
# NOTE: This is a MINIMAL test configuration for validating basic infrastructure.
# It uses minimal infrastructure components for isolated testing.

# Disable heartbeat system for infrastructure tests
# This is ONLY appropriate for minimal infrastructure testing where messaging
# components are intentionally not configured. All other test environments
# (HTTP tests, Edge tests, production) should have heartbeats ENABLED.

# In-Memory Infrastructure Configuration
# These settings enable local-only operation without external dependencies
# (Redis, RabbitMQ). ONLY for infrastructure testing - do NOT use in production.

## The Basics

Fermentation is the process of converting carbohydrates to alcohol or organic acids using microorganisms like yeast or bacteria. At its most basic, all that's needed for the process to take place is a container to hold the mixture at a suitable temperature for the microorganisms to work. Fermented products have historically been used as medicines, largely for digestive issues, as well as for preserving foods for winter or long travel (such as on ships). Fermented foods also have religious and ritualistic significance in many cultures, such as the wines made as part of shrine maiden ceremonies in Japan, or the wine that's consumed to symbolize the blood of christ in Christianity.

When fermented, materials become more acidic. When later broken down into fertilizer (by machine/slime), the resulting fertilizer will restore nutrients based on the base materials used (fish -> nitrogen, vegetables -> carbon), but will also increase acidity in the soil (pH adjustment more toward acidic). This is beneficial if the soil is more alkiline, but can be damaging if the soil is already acidic.

**Produces**: Fermented milk is used to make lassi, cheese, and yogurt. Fermented beans are used to make soy sauce and miso. Fermented fruit is used to make wine. Yeast is used to ferment grains to leavened bread, as well as to beer. Vegetables, fish, and meat can be fermented to simply have a longer shelf life.

**Produced in**: Basically any sealed container, or even open containers in an otherwise sealed or stable environment, such as a basement. Earthenware pots and jugs, wooden barrels, and stone vats are all common fermentation containers, depending on the scale needed. Animal skins (as bladders for storing liquids) have also been used for fermenting milk and other materials.

The common types of fermentation are:

- [Lactic Acid](#lactic-acid-fermentation)
- [Alcoholic](#alcoholic-fermentation)
- [Acetic Acid](#acetic-acid-fermentation)
- [Butric Acid](#butric-acid-fermentation)
- [Priopionic Acid](#propionic-acid-fermentation)

## Lactic Acid Fermentation

- **Process**: This type of fermentation is carried out by certain bacteria, including Lactobacillus. It converts sugars into cellular energy and the byproduct lactic acid.
- **Method**: In dairy fermentation, lactose (the sugar in milk) is converted into lactic acid, which helps preserve the product and gives it a distinct tangy flavor. For vegetables, the naturally present or added bacteria ferment the sugars in the vegetables, producing lactic acid.
- **Common Uses**: Lactic acid fermentation is used in the production of dairy products like yogurt and cheese, as well as in the preservation and flavoring of vegetables, meats, and fish (e.g., sauerkraut, kimchi, pickled vegetables).
- **Notes**: Salt's use in lactic acid fermentation is signficiant. Salt creates an environment where harmful bacteria struggle to survive, but lactic acid bacteria (which are salt-tolerant) can thrive. This helps to ensure that the fermentation is dominated by the desirable bacteria. Salt also draws water out of the cells of the vegetables (through osmosis), creating a brine. This brine provides an anaerobic environment (free from oxygen) which is ideal for lactic acid bacteria and prevents the growth of spoilage organisms that need oxygen.

Lactic acid fermentation is rarely used outside of culinary pursuits, or remedies / aids for digestive health. It can be used in creating natural insect repellents, in dying and textiles, tanning/leather production, but uncommonly, and acetic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation produce vinegar and alcohol, which are better for many of those applications anyways. Animals feed is the other significant industry- the downsides of fermented foods (namely, the smell and taste) are largely lost if feeding to animals which don't seem to mind it, and the preservative and antimicrobial effects would make the shelf life of feed significantly longer.

### Dairy-Based

- Milk -> Yogurt, Curd (Dahi), Cheese, Kefir
- **Method**: These products require the fermentation of lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid. They typically involve maintaining the milk at a certain temperature to promote the growth of lactic acid bacteria. Kefir also requires kefir grains, which include yeast and bacteria.

### Vegetable-Based

- Cabbage, Salt -> Sauerkraut
- Other Vegetables, Salt -> Fermented Vegetables (kimchi), Pickled Olives
- **Method**: These products involve submerging the vegetables in a saltwater brine or mixing them with salt to create an anaerobic environment favorable for lactic acid bacteria. The natural sugars in the vegetables fuel the fermentation process.

### Grain and Legume-Based

- Soy Beans, Koji, Wheat, Salt, Brine (saltwater) -> Soy Sauce
- Rice/Soy/Barley, Koji, Salt, Water -> Miso
- Rice, Lentils -> Dosa and Idli Batter
- Wheat, Yeast, Bacteria -> Sourdough Bread
- **Method**: These processes involve a combination of lactic acid fermentation and, in some cases, fungal fermentation (e.g., koji in soy sauce and miso). Grains or legumes are mixed with specific cultures and often salt to promote fermentation.

### Meat and Fish Preservation

- Meat, Salt -> Preserved Meat
- Fish, Salt -> Preserved Fish
- **Method**: Preservation involves curing the meat or fish with salt, sometimes along with other seasonings. The salt helps to draw out moisture and create an environment where lactic acid bacteria can thrive, preventing spoilage and adding flavor.

### Special Processes

- Cocoa Beans -> Fermented Cocoa (a step in making chocolate)
- Traditional Beverages (like kvass or grain-based kefir)
- **Method**: These involve unique fermentation processes that may include lactic acid fermentation among other types. Cocoa fermentation is typically a mixed fermentation process involving yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, and acetic acid bacteria.

## Alcoholic Fermentation

- **Process**: This type of fermentation is carried out by yeasts or bacteria. It converts carbohydrates/sugars (like glucose, fructose, and sucrose) into alcohol (ethanol) and carbon dioxide.
- **Method**: In beer brewing, grains (commonly barley) are malted, mashed, and then fermented. In winemaking, grape juice (or the juice of other fruits) is fermented. For bread, yeast ferments the sugars present in the flour.
Common Uses: Alcoholic fermentation is used in the production of alcoholic beverages like beer and wine. It's also the process that causes bread dough to rise.
- **Notes**: Usually requires anaerobic conditions, meaning sealed containers and keeping air out. The use of yeast speeds up the process, leads to faster, cleaner results, and reduces the need for optimal conditions to get a usable result, but is largely considered optional in most processes, as the natural bacteria and microbes in the materials is usually enough (eventually).

**Products**:

- Apples, Sugar (optional), Yeast (optional) -> Cider
- Pears, Sugar (optional), Yeast (optional) -> Perry
- Wheat, Yeast (optional) -> Leavened / Sourdough Bread
  - The leavening process involves yeast fermenting the sugars in the dough, producing CO2 (which makes the bread rise).
- Honey, Water, Yeast (optional) -> Mead
- Rice, Yeast, Koji -> Sake
- Rice, Yeast (optional) -> Rice Wine
- Grapes, Yeast (optional) -> Grape Wine
- Other Fruit, Yeast (optional) -> Wine
- Pineapple, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon -> Tepache
- Bread -> Kvass
- Local Grains, Local Fruits -> Traditional Beers
- Barley/Malt/Rice/Rye/Corn/Wheat, Hops -> Modern Beer

### Fruit-Based

- Apples, Sugar (optional), Yeast (optional) -> Cider
- Pears, Sugar (optional), Yeast (optional) -> Perry
- Grapes, Yeast (optional) -> Grape Wine
- Other Fruits, Yeast (optional) -> Fruit Wine
- Pineapple, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon -> Tepache
- **Method**: These processes involve fermenting the natural sugars present in fruits. The fermentation can be initiated by natural yeasts present on the fruit skins or by adding yeast. For some beverages like tepache, additional sugar sources (like brown sugar) are added to fuel fermentation.

### Grain-Based

- Barley/Malt/Rice/Rye/Corn/Hops/Wheat, Yeast (optional) -> Beer
- Rice, Yeast, Koji -> Sake
- Rice, Yeast (optional) -> Rice Wine
- Wheat, Yeast (optional) -> Kvass
- **Method**: These processes involve extracting sugars from grains (mashing) and then fermenting those sugars. The presence of yeast is crucial for converting the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The use of koji in sake production also involves a parallel process of breaking down rice starches into fermentable sugars.

### Honey-Based

- Honey, Water, Yeast (optional) -> Mead
- **Method**: The fermentation of honey with water. Yeast can be added to ensure a consistent and controlled fermentation process, but wild yeasts can also initiate fermentation.

### Bread-Based

- Wheat, Yeast (optional) -> Leavened / Sourdough Bread
- **Method**: This involves the fermentation of flour with natural yeasts and bacteria. The process not only leavens the bread but also adds flavor. Sourdough fermentation, in particular, involves a symbiotic relationship between yeast and lactic acid bacteria.

## Acetic Acid Fermentation

- **Process**: This fermentation converts ethanol into acetic acid in the presence of oxygen. It's carried out by bacteria such as Acetobacter.
- **Method**: To produce vinegar, alcoholic liquid (like wine or cider) is exposed to air, allowing the bacteria to convert the alcohol into acetic acid.
- **Common Uses**: The most common use of this type of fermentation is in the production of vinegar.
- **Notes**: Take any product of alcoholic fermentation (beer, cider, wine, etc), infuse it with a little vinegar to start (to speed things up), expose it to air (covered with cloth or something to keep out debris, ideally), and let it sit for weeks, months, or even years, and you get vinegar.

Vinegar has an immense number of practical uses, from cleaning to tanning, as a mild disenfectant, antiseptic, fixing colours to fabrics, insect repellent and herbicide, and preservative for paints / art supplies. The source of the vinegar isn't a major factor of a vinegar's usefulness in a particular (non-culinary) task, but it's acidity level can be a factor.

**Products**:

- Red/White Wine -> Wine Vinegar: Known for a rich, complex flavor.
- Apple Cider -> Apple Cider Vinegar: Valued for its fruity taste and potential health benefits.
- Rice Wine -> Rice Vinegar: Commonly used in Asian cuisine, known for its mild and slightly sweet flavor.
- Barley/Malt -> Malt Vinegar: Has a strong, distinctive flavor, commonly used in British cuisine.
- Beer -> Beer Vinegar: Distinct from Barley/Malt, can be made from any type of beer.
- Grape Must -> Balsamic Vinegar: Aged for several years, and known for its rich, sweet, and complex flavor.
- Spirits -> Spirit Vinegar: Fermented from distilled alcohol / spirits.

### Creating Vinegar

1. **Starting with Alcoholic Liquid**:
   - Begin with an alcoholic liquid like wine, cider, or beer. The type of alcoholic liquid will influence the flavor profile of the final vinegar.
2. **Oxygenation and Inoculation**:
   - Expose the alcoholic liquid to air to allow oxygen to interact with the liquid. This can be done in an open vessel covered with a breathable material to prevent contamination.
   - Inoculate the liquid with a small amount of live vinegar or "mother of vinegar" to introduce a culture of Acetobacter bacteria. This step isn't strictly necessary, as Acetobacter is naturally present in the air, but it can significantly speed up the process.
3. **Fermentation**:
   - Store the vessel in a warm, dark place. The Acetobacter bacteria will convert the ethanol in the alcoholic liquid to acetic acid, increasing the acidity of the liquid.
   - This process can take from a few weeks to several months, depending on factors like the initial alcohol content, the temperature, and the strength of the bacterial culture.
4. **Monitoring and Controlling Acidity**:
   - Monitor the progress of the fermentation by tasting the vinegar and/or measuring the acidity with pH strips or a titration kit.
   - Once the vinegar reaches the desired level of acidity, it can be transferred to sealed containers to stop the fermentation process and stabilize the acidity level.
5. **Aging (Optional)**:
   - Some types of vinegar, like balsamic, can be aged to develop more complex flavors. This involves storing the vinegar in wooden barrels for several years. The wood interacts with the vinegar, imparting additional flavors and allowing for a slow evaporation and concentration of the vinegar.
6. **Filtering and Bottling**:
   - Once the vinegar has reached the desired flavor and acidity, it can be filtered to remove any sediment and the mother of vinegar.
   - The clear vinegar can then be bottled. It's shelf-stable and does not require refrigeration.

## Butric Acid Fermentation

- **Process**: This fermentation converts sugars into butyric acid, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. It's carried out by bacteria such as Clostridium butyricum.
- **Common Uses**: It's not as commonly used in food production due to the strong smell of butyric acid, but it does occur naturally in the fermentation process of some cheeses and butter. It's primarily known for its role in certain types of food spoilage, and in the production of specific flavors in certain foods rather than in the manufacture of those foods themselves. In other words, it's a type of fermentation typically avoided.
- **Notes**: Butric acid fermentation can occur in certain types of cheese, particularly in the aging process of some hard cheeses. It's part of the complex microbial interactions that develop the flavor and texture of the cheese. This fermentation is usually not intentional and is controlled to prevent spoilage or the development of undesired flavors.

## Propionic Acid Fermentation

- **Process**: This type of fermentation is carried out by Propionibacterium and produces propionic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. It's a secondary fermentation that often follows lactic acid fermentation.
- **Common Uses**: It's significant in the production of Swiss-type cheeses (like Emmental and Gruyere), where it contributes to the development of the characteristic flavor and the holes (or "eyes") in the cheese. Propionic acid fermentation is also used in the production of certain types of bread, contributing to flavor and shelf life.
- **Notes**: Propionic Acid Fermentation, much like Butric Acid Fermentation, is a secondary fermentation process. It isn't used to create distinct products, but rather as an additional step / complexity to existing processes for cheese (lactic acid fermentation) and bread (alcoholic fermentation) to add a distinct flavour profile. This is largely considered a positive fermentation process.

## Yeast

Bread yeast and brewer's yeast share a common ancestry and have similarities. Both are strains of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but they have been selected and bred over time for specific characteristics suited to their respective tasks.

Here's how they differ and overlap.

### Baker's Yeast

  **Characteristics**: Bread yeast is selected for its ability to produce carbon dioxide rapidly, which is essential for leavening bread. It ferments sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol, but the alcohol evaporates during the baking process.
  Strains: The most common strain for baking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It's cultivated to be highly reliable and active in dough.

### Brewer's Yeast

  **Characteristics**: Brewer's yeast is selected for its ability to ferment sugars into alcohol and to contribute to the flavor profile of the beer or wine. It's more alcohol-tolerant than baker's yeast, meaning it can survive and ferment in higher alcohol concentrations.
  Strains: There are many strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in brewing, each offering different flavor profiles and fermentation characteristics. For wine, there are also specialized yeasts, like Saccharomyces bayanus, which are even more alcohol-tolerant.

### The Road to Baker's Yeast

#### Baker's Yeast - Initial Capture

- **Creating a Favorable Environment**: Start by mixing flour and water to make a thick paste. The flour (preferably whole grain, as it hasn't been stripped of its natural nutrients and microflora) provides food for the yeast, and the water activates the enzymes in the flour.
- **Exposure to Air**: Leave the mixture exposed to the air but covered with a breathable material like cheesecloth. This allows wild yeast and bacteria present in the environment to colonize the mixture. The specific strains of yeast and bacteria you capture will depend on your local environment, which is why sourdough starters can vary so much by region.
- **Waiting for Fermentation to Start**: Over the next few days, monitor the mixture for signs of fermentation: bubbles forming, a tangy smell developing, and the mixture rising and falling. This indicates that yeast and bacteria are consuming the sugars in the flour and producing carbon dioxide and alcohol (fermentation).

#### Baker's Yeast - Cultivating and Selecting

- **Feeding the Culture**: Regularly (usually once or twice a day), "feed" the culture by removing a portion of the mixture and adding fresh flour and water. This keeps the yeast active and helps select for strains that are well-adapted to this environment.
- **Observing and Selecting**: Over time, you may notice that the fermentation activity becomes more reliable and vigorous. This indicates that the more robust and well-adapted strains of yeast (and bacteria, in the case of sourdough) are becoming dominant.
- **Re-Using the Culture**: Once you have an active and vigorous culture, you can begin to use it to leaven bread. Each time you bake, reserve a portion of the starter to perpetuate the culture. This portion will be mixed with fresh flour and water to continue the cycle.

#### Baker's Yeast - Refinement over Generations

- **Selection Pressure**: As you continue this process over many cycles, you'll effectively be applying selection pressure, favoring yeast strains that perform well under the conditions you're providing (temperature, hydration, type of flour, etc.).
- **Isolation and Purification**: Over generations, you might start to isolate the culture from external influences to achieve more consistency. This could involve more controlled fermentation environments and more stringent hygiene practices to prevent contamination.
- **Stabilization**: Eventually, you would hope to achieve a stable culture where the desired yeast strains are reliably dominant, providing consistent fermentation results.
- **Drying and Preservation (advanced)**: For long-term storage and ease of use, you might experiment with drying the yeast. This involves spreading the culture thinly and allowing it to dry, then crushing it into a powder. This dried yeast can be reactivated by adding water.

### The Road to Brewer's Yeast

#### Brewer's Yeast - Initial Capture

- **Creating a Favorable Environment**: Start by preparing a small batch of "wort" (unfermented beer). This is done by extracting sugars from malted grains (usually barley) through a process called mashing. The wort should be boiled briefly to sterilize it, then cooled to fermentation temperature.
- **Exposure to Air**: Transfer the cooled wort to a sterilized container and leave it exposed to the air but covered with a breathable material like cheesecloth. This allows wild yeast and bacteria present in the environment to enter the wort. The specific strains of yeast and bacteria you capture will depend on your local environment.
- **Waiting for Fermentation to Start**: Over the next few days, monitor the wort for signs of fermentation: bubbles forming, a change in aroma, and perhaps a change in clarity or color. This indicates that yeast is consuming the sugars in the wort and producing carbon dioxide and alcohol (fermentation).

#### Brewer's Yeast - Cultivating and Selecting

- **Feeding the Culture**: If you capture a yeast culture that you want to maintain, you'll need to feed it regularly with fresh wort. This keeps the yeast active and allows you to grow the population of yeast cells.
- **Observing and Selecting**: Over time, observe the fermentation characteristics: flavor, attenuation (how much sugar is converted to alcohol), and flocculation (how well the yeast settles after fermentation). Choose the yeast that performs best according to your brewing goals.
- **Re-Using the Culture**: After fermentation, you can collect yeast from the bottom of the fermentation vessel (for bottom-fermenting yeast) or from the top (for top-fermenting yeast). This yeast can be used to inoculate new batches of wort.

#### Brewer's Yeast - Refinement over Generations

- **Selection Pressure**: As with bread yeast, applying selection pressure by choosing yeast that performs well under your specific brewing conditions is key. Factors include alcohol tolerance, flavor profile, and fermentation speed.
- **Isolation and Purification**: Unlike with sourdough, where a community of microorganisms is desirable, brewing typically aims for a pure yeast culture. This might involve techniques like yeast washing or even plating out yeast on agar to isolate single colonies for propagation.
- **Stabilization**: With each successful batch, you'll refine the characteristics of your yeast. Consistency in your brewing process will help stabilize the traits of your yeast culture.
- **Storage and Preservation**: Yeast can be stored in a refrigerator for short-term use. For long-term storage, yeast slurry can be mixed with glycerol and frozen. Alternatively, yeast can be dried, but this process is more complex and may require specialized equipment to do effectively.

#### Brewer's Yeast - Notable Differences

- **Sterility**: Brewing requires more stringent sterilization practices compared to bread making. The wort must be boiled and all equipment must be sanitized to prevent unwanted microbial contamination.
- **Control**: The process of cultivating brewer's yeast often requires more control and monitoring, especially in terms of temperature and sterilization.
- **Isolation**: While sourdough thrives on a mixture of yeast and bacteria, beer brewing generally aims for a pure yeast culture to ensure consistency and prevent off-flavors.

## Impact of Elemental Magic

Fermentation is a biological process used in food preservation, production of alcoholic beverages, and various industrial applications. Elemental magic, particularly the ability to manipulate energy and environmental conditions, could significantly enhance and diversify fermentation processes in a pre-industrial society.

**Theoretical Impact**:

1. **Optimized Fermentation Conditions**:
   - **Temperature Control**: Magic could be used to maintain optimal temperatures for specific fermentation processes, ensuring that microbial cultures remain active and productive.
   - **Environmental Stability**: The ability to control the environment around fermentation vessels could prevent contamination and create conditions ideal for the desired microbial activity.

2. **Accelerated Fermentation Rates**:
   - **Rapid Cultivation**: Magic could accelerate the growth and metabolic rates of fermenting microbes, reducing the time required to produce fermented foods, beverages, or industrial products.
   - **Enhanced Product Quality**: Faster fermentation could lead to more consistent and high-quality products, as the reduced time might limit the potential for spoilage or off-flavors.

3. **Innovative Fermentation Techniques**:
   - **Novel Flavors and Textures**: Elemental magic could allow for the exploration of new fermentation techniques, potentially leading to the creation of novel flavors, textures, and types of fermented products.
   - **Selective Fermentation**: Magic could be used to promote or inhibit the activity of specific microbes, enabling more precise control over the fermentation process and the characteristics of the final product.

4. **Improved Preservation and Storage**:
   - **Extended Shelf Life**: By ensuring optimal fermentation and storage conditions, magic could help extend the shelf life of fermented products, making them safer and more enjoyable to consume over time.
   - **Enhanced Nutritional Content**: Controlled fermentation could maximize the nutritional benefits of fermented foods, such as the availability of vitamins, probiotics, and enzymes.

5. **Environmental and Safety Impact**:
   - **Resource Conservation**: More efficient fermentation processes could reduce the need for raw materials, energy, and space, contributing to a more sustainable production.
   - **Waste Reduction**: Optimized fermentation could minimize the production of waste products and by-products, enhancing the overall efficiency and cleanliness of the process.

Elemental magic's ability to finely control the conditions and rates of fermentation could transform this ancient practice, enabling more efficient, diverse, and high-quality production of fermented foods, beverages, and industrial products.

## Cooling Crystallization to Make Sugar

Cooling crystallization is a process used to produce sugar crystals from a saturated sugar solution. This process was traditionally used in sugar production from sugar cane or sugar beets.

**Equipment/Steps**:

1. **Extraction**:
   - Extract the sugar juice from the sugar cane or beets by crushing and pressing the raw material.

2. **Purification**:
   - Boil the extracted juice and remove impurities that rise to the surface. Impurities can be skimmed off, leaving a cleaner sugar solution.

3. **Concentration**:
   - Evaporate water from the purified juice by boiling it in large, open pans. The juice becomes more concentrated as water is evaporated.

4. **Crystallization**:
   - Allow the concentrated sugar solution to cool. As the solution cools, sugar begins to crystallize out of the solution.
   - Stir the cooling solution to encourage even crystallization and prevent the sugar from sticking to the sides of the pan.

5. **Collection and Drying**:

# Elemental Magic

"Elemental magic," as defined for the purpose of these primers, refers to a controlled and nuanced form of magic that allows individuals to manipulate and alter the state of matter at a fundamental level, particularly focusing on the manipulation of temperature and energy. This form of magic does not defy the laws of thermodynamics but rather serves as a means to channel energy from an unspecified source ("somewhere else") to influence physical processes. It does not involve creating or destroying matter but rather changing its state (solid, liquid, gas) or influencing its properties in a controlled manner.

Key points about elemental magic include:

1. **Manifestation of Energy**: Elemental magic allows the user to manifest energy to heat or cool substances, essentially providing or removing heat energy from a process.

2. **State Transformation**: It can change the state of materials (e.g., melting, freezing, evaporating) without changing their molecular composition.

3. **Controlled and Targeted Application**: The magic can be applied in a precise and localized manner, affecting specific parts of a process or material without broad, indiscriminate impact.

4. **Supplementary to Natural Processes**: Elemental magic acts as a supplement to natural processes, speeding them up or making them more efficient, rather than replacing them entirely.

5. **Non-Invasive and Subtle**: The use of magic is subtle and non-invasive. It doesn't drastically alter the natural course of events but gently nudges processes in the desired direction.

6. **No Creation or Destruction of Matter**: The magic doesn't create new materials or destroy them; it merely alters their current state or properties.

This interpretation of magic is designed to be less fantastical and more grounded, integrating with the natural world and its processes in a way that feels organic and part of the fabric of the universe in the game world. It's more about enhancing and influencing what already exists rather than conjuring or annihilating matter.

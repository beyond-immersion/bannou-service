## Introduction

Herbal medicine represents a convergence of tradition, nature, and healing, offering a holistic approach to healthcare rooted in the knowledge of generations. Utilizing the potent properties of plants, practitioners of herbal medicine craft remedies that address a myriad of ailments, harnessing nature's bounty to promote healing, balance, and well-being. In pre-industrial societies, these practices were not merely methods of treatment but were intertwined with the cultural and spiritual fabric of the community, often guided by herbalists, healers, or wise women and men who possessed an intimate understanding of local flora and their medicinal uses. This primer aims to preserve and convey this ancient wisdom, ensuring that the art of herbal medicine making, with its rich heritage and proven efficacy, is accessible and comprehensible for all.

## Materials Commonly Used

### Herbs

- **Leafy Herbs**: Mint, basil, sage, and others used for their leaves.
- **Roots**: Ginger, ginseng, and turmeric known for their potent roots.
- **Barks**: Cinnamon, willow bark, and others valued for their bark.
- **Flowers**: Lavender, chamomile, and roses used for their floral parts.
- **Seeds**: Fennel, cardamom, and others used for their seeds.

### Solvents

- **Water**: Used in infusions and decoctions.
- **Alcohol**: Utilized for tinctures due to its ability to extract and preserve.
- **Oil**: Used for macerations to extract oil-soluble compounds.
- **Vinegar**: Employed as a preservative and for its own health benefits.

## Common/Required Equipment

### Mortar and Pestle

- **Earliest Forms**: The most primitive mortar and pestle were likely made from stone or wood. The mortar would be a sturdy, bowl-shaped object, while the pestle would be a rounded, club-like tool, used to grind and crush herbs.
- **Use and Effectiveness**: Essential for grinding herbs into powders or pastes, releasing their active ingredients. The effectiveness depends on the hardness of the materials used and the fineness of the grind desired.

### Jars and Bottles

- **Earliest Forms**: Early containers were made from natural materials like gourds, animal horns, or wood. Later, pottery and glass became prevalent for their non-reactive and preservative qualities.
- **Use and Effectiveness**: Vital for storing herbal preparations. The material of the container can affect the shelf life and potency of the stored medicine.

### Strainers or Cheesecloth

- **Earliest Forms**: Woven baskets or cloths made from natural fibers were used to separate solid plant matter from liquid preparations.
- **Use and Effectiveness**: Crucial for ensuring clarity and purity in infusions, decoctions, and tinctures. The fineness of the weave determines the clarity of the final product.

### Pans and Pots

- **Earliest Forms**: Originally made from clay or stone, these were used over open fires or in hearths for cooking and preparing decoctions.
- **Use and Effectiveness**: Fundamental for heat-based extraction methods like decoctions. The material and shape influence the even distribution of heat and prevention of burning.

### Scales

- **Earliest Forms**: Balance scales with counterweights were among the first tools for measuring. Accuracy depended on the quality of the scale and the standardization of weights.
- **Use and Effectiveness**: Precision in measuring herbs and solvents ensures consistent strength and quality in herbal remedies.

### Labels

- **Earliest Forms**: Early labels might have been simple markings on containers or tags made from leather, cloth, or wood.
- **Use and Effectiveness**: Proper labeling is crucial for the identification of ingredients, preparation dates, and dosage instructions, ensuring the safe and effective use of herbal medicines.

## Methodologies and Processes

### 1. Infusions

### 2. Decoctions

- **Description**: Simmering tougher plant parts like roots and bark to extract their active ingredients.
- **Steps**:
  - Add the herb to water and bring to a boil.
  - Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half.
  - Strain and use.

### 3. Tinctures

- **Description**: Soaking herbs in alcohol to extract alcohol-soluble compounds.
- **Steps**:
  - Fill a jar with herbs.
  - Pour alcohol over the herbs until fully submerged.
  - Seal the jar and store in a cool, dark place for several weeks, shaking it periodically.
  - Strain and use.

### 4. Macerations

- **Description**: Soaking herbs in oils to extract oil-soluble compounds.
- **Steps**:
  - Fill a jar with herbs and pour oil over them until fully submerged.
  - Seal the jar and store in a warm, sunny place for several weeks.
  - Strain and use.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Making Common Medicines

### Calendula Salve

**Materials Needed**:

- Fresh calendula flowers
- Olive oil (or any available oil)
- Beeswax
- Jars or containers for storage

**Tools Used**:

- Mortar and Pestle (earliest form, made from stone or wood)
- Strainer or Cheesecloth (woven from natural fibers)
- Pan or Pot (made from clay or stone)
- Wooden Spoon (for stirring)
- Balance Scale (primitive balance scale with counterweights for measuring beeswax)

**Gathering Process**:

1. **Harvesting Calendula**:
   - Collect fresh calendula flowers, preferably in the morning after the dew has evaporated.
   - Choose flowers that are fully open and vibrant in color, indicating high medicinal quality.

**Preparation Process**:

1. **Infusing Oil with Calendula**:
   - Pluck the petals from the calendula flowers and grind them gently using a mortar and pestle to release their oils.
   - Place the crushed petals in a pan or pot and cover them with olive oil. The oil should be just enough to submerge the petals.
   - Heat the mixture on low heat for 2-3 hours, ensuring that the oil does not boil but is warm enough to facilitate the infusion. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon.
   - After heating, let the mixture cool and then strain it using a strainer or cheesecloth into a clean jar or container. Press the petals to extract as much oil as possible.

2. **Making the Salve**:
   - Measure beeswax using the balance scale. The typical ratio is one part beeswax to four parts infused oil.
   - Gently heat the infused oil in the pan or pot and add beeswax to it.
   - Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the beeswax melts completely and is well combined with the oil.
   - Once the mixture is homogeneous, remove it from heat and let it cool slightly. Pour it into jars or containers before it hardens.

**Usage**:

- Apply the calendula salve to the affected skin area.
- Store the salve in a cool, dry place. It should last for up to a year if stored properly.

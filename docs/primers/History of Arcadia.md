## The Age of Creation

In the early times, millions of years ago, the Gods created worlds. These Gods would eventually be seen as the personifications of concepts, of natural laws, but it's unknown if they personify the law, a concept that had already existed, or if the concept exists because they do. The Gods mostly kept to their own little universes at first, leaving the others to their works, and any conflict was purely for entertainment/experimentation, rather than out of any real malice or need. Gods, as concepts, were largely unable to even understand each other, why they did the things they did, unless they had some shared influence.

Each world that a God created would eventually collapse though- the Void, the nothingness that exists outside of a world, would find a way through the cracks, a little at a time, until finally it was all reduced to nothing too. To combat this, the Gods begin to work together, in pairs, then more- they used their powers to create larger, more complex worlds, and these lasted longer. However, those too still eventually succumbed to the Void, just the same. Finally, tired of seeing their works destroyed, almost all of the Gods came together, and cooperated (having found a common goal for the first time), and created the largest, most complex world yet, pouring all of their combined creative energies into it. They rested, waiting, watching the world grow, and over the millenia life spread over their new world in shapes and varieties they had never seen, and not intended. The interactions of all of their combined energies was beyond any ability to predict- they had triggered something truly unique, and the Gods were mesmerized by what they saw.

Eventually though, signs began to appear- erosions in the fabric of the world from which nightmares emerged to drag others in. The Void had started to eat this world, as well. The Gods decided they couldn't let this world be destroyed as well, and had to stop this phenomena somehow. Banding together and using their powers of creation once more, and their knowledge of the manifestation of concepts, they manifested the concept of the Void as a physical being, so that it might be possible to actually defeat. What they created though, was an indescribable monstrosity- the sum of all nightmares. They now understood that the Void as a concept was much larger than any of them, individually, and it took all of them many, many years, fighting together, even losing some of the Gods in the process, to finally seal it away.

The world would be safe from erosions going forward so long as the seal was intact, and they used a great deal of their combined power to ensure that it would always be. That left them quite a bit weaker, as they returned to the world they protected together.

### Dramatic Rewrite (ChatGPT)

In the epoch before epochs, the cosmos lay as an unfathomable canvas of potential, waiting for the touch of the primordial forces. The gods, born from the very essence of nature's fundamental laws, stirred in the abyss. Gravitas, the god of gravity, first imposed harmony upon the celestial chaos, drawing the stardust into a dance of cosmic order. Chronos, the god of time, then wove the fabric of moments, each tick a delicate thread in the infinite tapestry of the universe. In this nascent era, the gods witnessed the fleeting beauty of their creations, ephemeral and delicate, as the Void, an insatiable emptiness, whispered oblivion into the heart of existence, dissolving realms as swiftly as they were conjured.

Individually, the gods crafted realms of indescribable majesty. Nebulos, the god of chaos, shaped worlds where land and sky were canvases for the whims of imagination, while Luminar, the god of light, birthed constellations that sang in radiant chorus. Obscurus, the god of darkness, nurtured realms where life thrived in the serenity of shadows. Yet, these worlds, each a manifestation of divine will, were but transient dreams, succumbing to the relentless erosion of the Void, leaving naught but a whisper of their former splendor.

The gods, in their solitary grandeur, discerned a pattern; the more energy and unity they invested in their creations, the longer these realms resisted the encroaching nothingness. Thus, in an unprecedented confluence of divine intent, they converged their powers. Gravitas orchestrated the forces of nature, binding their energies in a delicate equilibrium, while Chronos ensured the seamless unfolding of their collective endeavor. Together, they birthed a world of unparalleled complexity, a masterpiece of their united vision. Infinitas, the god of infinity, infused the world with boundless diversity, while Metamorphos, the god of transformation, wove the essence of change and adaptation into the very fabric of this vibrant realm.

However, as life flourished and the world blossomed in its untamed glory, the gods observed with a bittersweet pang the familiar, creeping tendrils of the Void. Determined to shield their magnum opus from oblivion, the gods united in an act of defiance against the formless destroyer. The god of barriers erected fortifications of mystic might, while Sagacius, the god of wisdom, unraveled the patterns of the encroaching chaos, seeking to predict and thwart its path. In a monumental act of divine will, they manifested the essence of the Void into a form they could confront—a monstrosity born from the collective fears and darkness of creation itself, an adversary they hoped to vanquish once and for all.

The ensuing battle transcended the bounds of time and space, a clash of primordial energies that resonated through the very fabric of reality. The gods, driven by a fierce resolve to protect their cherished creation, waged a war of unimaginable scale. Epochs passed in the blink of an eye, stars were born and extinguished as mere flickers in the shadow of their struggle, and eventually, the manifestation of the Void, now the Great Demon Nullius, was sealed away, locked behind barriers wrought of their combined strength and sacrifice. Weakened yet steadfast, the gods retreated into the weave of the world they had so dearly defended, their essence permeating every mountain, every stream, every breath of the wind. This world, a testament to their unity and resilience, thrived under the silent vigil of its divine guardians, a primal realm of intricate beauty and complexity, forever cherished by the gods who had breathed life into its very essence.

## The Age of Advancement

In the wake of creation, the gods, like celestial shepherds, guided the ever-evolving tapestry of life. The Age of Advancement dawned, an era where the divine and the mortal realms intertwined like the roots of an ancient tree. Intelligent beings, in their nascent curiosity and vigor, roamed the landscapes, their spirits resonating with the gods who watched over them. These deities, ethereal and timeless, became guardians to those whose ideals echoed their own cosmic essences. They bestowed their blessings upon chosen beings, who, in turn, embodied the divine will, their very existence a testament to the ideals they revered. These blessed ones, granted strength and abilities beyond their kin, thrived under the celestial patronage, upholding the sacred pact between the heavens and the earth.

As the wheel of time turned, diversity flourished across Arcadia. Races of myriad forms and thoughts emerged, weaving the rich tapestry of life with the threads of knowledge, invention, and industry. Yet, this era of burgeoning progress cast a shadow upon the world. The relentless march of industry began to taint the purity of Arcadia, its poisonous breath whispering decay into the heart of nature. The celestial beings watched, their hearts heavy, as the creations they had nurtured began to drift away from the harmony that once existed.

## The Age of Division

The growing decay heralded the Age of Division, a time of contemplation and conflict among the divine. The gods stood divided, their celestial court echoing with debates on the fate of Arcadia. One faction, guardians of the natural order, argued vehemently to shield the world from the encroaching pollution. They believed that knowledge, the sacred flame of enlightenment, must be safeguarded, and the world's resources meticulously managed to prevent degradation. They held that the world's beauty, its integrity, and its wholeness were its greatest treasures, to be preserved at all costs.

Conversely, another faction of gods embraced the cycle of change with open arms. They argued that decay, though an unwelcome guest, was an integral part of the cosmic dance. The degradation, the inevitable end of one era, would merely sow the seeds for a new beginning, a phoenix rising from the ashes of the old. Unlike the desolation wrought by the Void, this cycle was a natural progression, a testament to the resilience and perpetual renewal of life, transcending any single species or being.

In the midst of this celestial tumult, the gods reached a monumental decision—to cleave Arcadia into two. One half was entrusted to the gods who championed progress, technology, and the natural cycle of life and death. They envisioned a world where innovation and change fueled the march of existence. The other half was bestowed upon the gods who sang hymns of preservation, order, and peace. This realm was meticulously partitioned into 'Realms,' each a sovereign dominion under the watchful eye of its patron deity.

Amidst this division, one goddess found her heart torn—Nexius, the goddess of connections and communication. To her, severing the intricate web of relationships, the exchange of ideas and dreams, was a fate far more grievous than the fading of beauty or the whispers of decay. The very essence of Arcadia, she believed, lay in the rich tapestry of its stories, the interwoven lives of its denizens. Her pleas, impassioned yet serene, echoed unheard in the divine council. Undeterred and unaligned, Nexius chose a path untrodden, refusing to claim a Realm or a people, her vision extending beyond the confines of the gods' decree.

As the world split, the gods, in an act of collective will, summoned the energies latent in the revered relics and sanctums of old. Limitar, the god of boundaries, channeled this power, conjuring formidable barriers, walls that defied not just armies, but the very essence of intrusion, forever altering the landscape of Arcadia. These walls, insurmountable and solemn, stood as silent sentinels, marking the dawn of an era where the world, once whole, now whispered tales of division and longing, awaiting the unfolding of destinies yet unseen.

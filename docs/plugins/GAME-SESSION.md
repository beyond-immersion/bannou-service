## Overview

Multiplayer session container primitive (L2 GameFoundation) with subscription-driven shortcut publishing for basic game access. Manages two session types: **lobby** sessions (persistent, per-game-service entry points auto-created for subscribed accounts) and **matchmade** sessions (pre-created by matchmaking with reservation tokens and TTL-based expiry). Integrates with Permission for `in_game` state tracking and Subscription for account eligibility. Publishes WebSocket shortcuts to connected clients for one-click game join, lifecycle events for session state changes, and supports per-game horizontal scaling via `SupportedGameServices` partitioning.

GameSession is to players what Inventory is to items: a **container primitive**. It owns who is in what multiplayer context, with distributed locking, reservation tokens, and permission state management. Higher-layer services (Gardener, Matchmaking) create and manage these containers for their own purposes.

## Architectural Role

### What GameSession IS

GameSession is a **multiplayer session container primitive**. Its core responsibilities:

1. **Container CRUD** — create, join, leave, kick with distributed locking
2. **Reservation token system** — cryptographically secure one-time tokens for matchmaking
3. **Permission state tracking** — sets/clears `in_game` on Permission service
4. **Session lifecycle events** — `created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `player-joined`, `player-left`, `cancelled`
5. **Basic game-access shortcuts** — subscription-driven lobby shortcuts as an L2 fallback

### What GameSession is NOT

- **Not the player entry experience** — that's Gardener (L4), which orchestrates voids, gardens, POIs, and scenario selection
- **Not player identity** — that's Auth/Connect (L1), which manages JWT sessions and WebSocket connections
- **Not the UX capability surface** — that's Agency (L4), which translates guardian spirit seed growth into UI module fidelity
- **Not game access control** — that's Subscription (L2), which tracks which accounts can access which games

### Relationship with Gardener (L4)

Gardener is the **player experience orchestrator** — the player-side counterpart to Puppetmaster. Where GameSession provides containers, Gardener decides *when and why* to put players in them:

| Concern | GameSession (L2) | Gardener (L4) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| "Who is in this multiplayer context?" | Owns this | Consumes this |
| "What does the player experience?" | No opinion | Owns this |
| "How does a player enter a game?" | Primitive shortcuts (L2 fallback) | Rich discovery experience (voids, POIs, scenarios) |
| "What happens during gameplay?" | Container membership tracking | Garden context, entity associations, scenario lifecycle |

**Current flow**: Gardener creates GameSession containers to back scenarios (`GameType="gardener-scenario"`), uses session IDs for cleanup tracking, and calls `LeaveGameSessionByIdAsync` on scenario completion. Matchmaking similarly creates containers with reservation tokens.

**Coexistence**: Games that declare `autoLobbyEnabled: true` on their GameService definition get naive lobby shortcuts from GameSession on connect. Games that declare `autoLobbyEnabled: false` (like Arcadia) rely on Gardener for entry orchestration. Both coexist in the same deployment — GameSession checks `autoLobbyEnabled` via `IGameServiceClient` before publishing subscription-driven shortcuts.

**L2-only deployments** (no L4): GameSession's subscription-driven shortcut pipeline provides basic game entry. Players get shortcuts, join lobbies, and the container tracks membership. This is functional but lacks the rich progressive discovery experience that Gardener provides.

### Relationship with Agency (L4)

**None.** Agency is orthogonal — it translates guardian spirit seed growth into UX module fidelity. Agency works with seeds, not sessions. GameSession and Agency never interact.

## Type Field Classification

| Field | Category | Type | Rationale |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|
| `SessionType` | C (System State) | Service-specific enum (`lobby`, `matchmade`) | Finite set of two system-owned session modes with fundamentally different join behaviors (persistent vs time-limited with reservations) |
| `SessionStatus` | C (System State) | Service-specific enum (`waiting`, `active`, `full`, `finished`) | Finite session lifecycle state machine; system-owned transitions |
| `PlayerRole` | C (System State) | Service-specific enum (`player`, `spectator`, `moderator`) | Finite set of system-owned roles determining session permissions |
| `ChatMessageType` | C (System State) | Service-specific enum (`public`, `whisper`, `system`) | Finite set of system-owned message delivery modes |
| `GameActionType` | B (Content Code) | Opaque string | Game-defined action type codes (e.g., `move`, `interact`, `attack`). Extensible without schema changes; new action types added at deployment time per game |
| `GameType` | B (Content Code) | Opaque string | Game service stub name (e.g., "arcadia", "fantasia", "generic"). Extensible without schema changes; new games added by creating game service definitions |

---

## Dependents (What Relies On This Plugin)

| Dependent | Layer | Relationship |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| lib-matchmaking | L4 | Creates matchmade sessions with reservations via `IGameSessionClient.CreateGameSessionAsync`; calls `PublishJoinShortcutAsync` to notify players |
| lib-gardener | L4 | Creates `gardener-scenario` sessions to back player scenarios via `IGameSessionClient.CreateGameSessionAsync`; calls `LeaveGameSessionByIdAsync` on completion/abandonment; subscribes to `game-session.deleted` for observational logging |
| lib-analytics | L4 | Maps session IDs to game-service IDs via `IGameSessionClient.GetGameSessionAsync`; subscribes to `game-session.created`, `game-session.deleted`, and `game-session.action.performed` for event ingestion and cache maintenance |

## Stubs & Unimplemented Features

*No current stubs.*

---

## Potential Extensions

1. **Spectator mode**: Allow joining with a `Spectator` role that receives events but cannot perform actions.
<!-- AUDIT:NEEDS_DESIGN:2026-03-08:https://github.com/beyond-immersion/bannou-service/issues/594 -->
2. **Session persistence/replay**: Store action history for replay or late-join state reconstruction.
<!-- AUDIT:NEEDS_DESIGN:2026-03-08:https://github.com/beyond-immersion/bannou-service/issues/595 -->
3. **Cross-instance lobby sync**: Replace the single `session-list` key with a proper indexed query for scaling.

## Horizontal Scaling by Game

The `SupportedGameServices` configuration enables **per-game horizontal scaling** by partitioning which game-session instances handle which games. Currently implemented as a comma-delimited string (violation — should be a typed array in the configuration schema). Filters which `subscription.updated` events the instance processes.

### How It Works

```
Deployment Topology (example)
==============================

Node A (main) Node B (arcadia) Node C (fantasia)
───────────────────────────── ───────────────────────── ─────────────────────────
SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES=generic SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES= SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES=
 arcadia fantasia

Handles: Handles: Handles:
 • Generic catch-all lobbies • Arcadia game lobbies • Fantasia game lobbies
 • Unknown/new games • Arcadia subscriptions • Fantasia subscriptions


subscription.updated event (stubName="arcadia") published
 │
 ├─► Node A: IsOurService("arcadia") → false → ignores
 ├─► Node B: IsOurService("arcadia") → true → processes, publishes shortcut
 └─► Node C: IsOurService("arcadia") → false → ignores
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Main node - handles generic/catch-all (default)
GAME_SESSION_SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES=generic

# Dedicated game nodes
GAME_SESSION_SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES=arcadia
GAME_SESSION_SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES=fantasia

# Multi-game node
GAME_SESSION_SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES=arcadia,fantasia
```

> **Important**: If you create a new game service (e.g., `my-new-game`), subscription-based lobby shortcuts **will not work** until you add it to `SupportedGameServices` on at least one game-session instance. The default configuration only handles `generic`. This is by design for horizontal scaling, but means new games are silent until configured.

### Why This Works Transparently

Because **all game-session endpoints are accessed via prebound shortcuts** (not direct API calls), clients never need to know which node handles which game. When a subscription is created:

1. The `subscription.updated` event is published to all game-session instances
2. Only the instance configured to handle that game's `stubName` processes the event
3. That instance publishes the join shortcut to the player's WebSocket session
4. The shortcut routes to the correct node automatically via the mesh

This enables games to be moved between nodes, scaled independently, or consolidated without any client-side changes.

---

## Generic Lobbies

When `GenericLobbiesEnabled` is `true` AND `"generic"` is in `SupportedGameServices`, the service publishes a generic lobby shortcut to **all authenticated sessions** immediately on connect—without requiring a subscription.

### Use Cases

- **Open catch-all lobbies**: Players can join a general lobby without subscribing to any specific game
- **Testing/development**: Simplifies integration testing without subscription setup
- **Free-to-play entry points**: Let players experience multiplayer before committing to a game subscription

### Behavior

| GenericLobbiesEnabled | "generic" in SupportedGameServices | Result |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------|
| `false` (default) | Yes | Generic shortcuts require subscription to "generic" service |
| `true` | Yes | Generic shortcuts auto-published to all authenticated sessions |
| `true` | No | No effect (instance doesn't handle generic) |
| `false` | No | No effect (instance doesn't handle generic) |

### Configuration

```bash
# Enable generic lobbies on the main node
GAME_SESSION_SUPPORTED_GAME_SERVICES=generic
GAME_SESSION_GENERIC_LOBBIES_ENABLED=true
```

### Flow Comparison

```
WITHOUT GenericLobbiesEnabled (subscription required):
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
User connects → session.connected event
 │
 ├── Check subscriptions for "generic"
 │ └── Not subscribed? → No shortcut published
 │
 └── User must subscribe to "generic" first


WITH GenericLobbiesEnabled:
───────────────────────────
User connects → session.connected event
 │
 ├── GenericLobbiesEnabled=true && IsOurService("generic")
 │ └── Immediately publish generic lobby shortcut
 │
 └── User can join generic lobby without any subscription
```

## Known Quirks & Caveats

### Bugs (Fix Immediately)

1. **SupportedGameServices is a comma-delimited string parsed at runtime**: The `SupportedGameServices` configuration property is a comma-delimited string that is split and parsed at runtime. Per Implementation Tenets (Configuration-First), comma-delimited strings for structured configuration bypass compile-time type safety and schema validation. Should be a typed array in the configuration schema with individual entries or `$ref` items.

2. **ListGameSessions does not apply GameType/Status filters**: The schema defines `GameType` and `Status` filter parameters on the list request, but the implementation ignores them, returning all non-finished sessions. This is dead schema (the properties exist but have no effect).

3. **CreateGameSession orphans session record on session-list lock failure**: The session record is written to the state store BEFORE acquiring the session-list lock. If the lock acquisition fails (returns 409), the session record persists as an orphan — unreachable via listing, never cleaned up. The write should be inside the lock, or the session record should be deleted as compensation on lock failure.

### Intentional Quirks

1. **Lobby stored twice**: Auto-created lobbies are saved under both `session:{sessionId}` and `lobby:{stubName}` keys. The lobby key enables O(1) lookup by game type; the session key enables the standard session operations. Potential for drift if one write fails.

2. **Null session timeout = no expiry**: `DefaultSessionTimeoutSeconds` is `int?` (nullable). When null (the default), `SessionTtlOptions` is null and no TTL is applied to state store saves. Sessions persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted or cleaned up.

3. **Whisper to non-existent target silently succeeds**: If the whisper target isn't in the session (or has left), the whisper is silently not delivered to them. The sender still receives their copy. No error returned.

4. **Chat returns OK when no players exist**: Returns `StatusCodes.OK` even when all players have left (no WebSocket sessions to deliver to). From the sender's perspective, the message "sent" successfully.

5. **Lock owner is random GUID per call**: Lock calls use `Guid.NewGuid().ToString()` as the lock owner. This means the same service instance cannot extend or re-acquire its own lock - each call gets a new identity.

6. **Join validates subscriber session but Leave does not**: `JoinGameSessionAsync` calls `IsValidSubscriberSessionAsync` to verify authorization, but leave operations only check player membership in the session. This is intentional — authorization is verified at join time; leave should always succeed regardless of subscription status. Trapping a player in a session because their subscription expired mid-game would be harmful UX.

### Design Considerations (Requires Planning)

1. **Session list is a single key**: All session IDs are stored in one `session-list` key (a `List<string>`). Listing loads ALL IDs then loads each session individually. No database-level pagination. With thousands of sessions, this becomes a bottleneck.
<!-- AUDIT:NEEDS_DESIGN:2026-03-03:https://github.com/beyond-immersion/bannou-service/issues/557 -->

2. **No cleanup of finished lobbies from session-list**: When a lobby's status becomes `Finished`, it remains in the `session-list` key. The cleanup service only handles matchmade session reservations, not lobby lifecycle.

## Work Tracking

*This section tracks active development work. Markers are managed by `/audit-plugin` workflow.*

### Completed

- **Join validates subscriber session but Leave does not** — Moved from Design Considerations to Intentional Quirk #6 (2026-03-08). Behavior is correct: authorization verified at join time; leave always succeeds regardless of subscription status.
- **CleanupPlayerModel property name mismatch** — Fixed and verified (2026-03-08). `WebSocketSessionId` renamed to `SessionId`. Comment documents the alignment requirement.
- **KickPlayer Finished transition / permission clearing / SendChatMessage validation** — Code verified fixed (2026-03-14). Map bug notes outdated; map update needed. KickPlayer now transitions to Finished on 0 players and clears permission state. SendChatMessage now validates sender membership via server-side session ID.

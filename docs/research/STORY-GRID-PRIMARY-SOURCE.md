## Executive Summary

The Story Grid is a systematic framework for analyzing and crafting compelling stories. Key components:

1. **Genre taxonomy** - 9 External + 3 Internal content genres with specific conventions and obligatory scenes
2. **Five Commandments** - Universal elements every story unit must have
3. **Value spectrum analysis** - Tracking life value shifts across genre
4. **Structural mathematics** - 25/50/25 proportions, scene counts, unit hierarchy
5. **Foolscap method** - One-page planning framework

**Critical principle**: "There is no Formula, just Form" - these principles describe underlying structure of ALL working stories, not a template to plug into.

---

## 3. The Five Commandments (UNIVERSAL)

**Critical Principle**: These five elements MUST appear in EVERY unit of story: beat, scene, sequence, act, subplot, and global story.

### Commandment 1: Inciting Incident

**Definition**: Event that upsets life balance of protagonist(s), making them uncomfortably out of sync.

**Two Types**:
| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| Causal | Result of active choice | Wife leaves husband; Man enlists in Marines |
| Coincidental | Unexpected, random, accidental | Man wins lottery; Woman takes wrong suitcase |

**Critical Rule**: Inciting Incident must PROMISE the ending
- Ending must be perfectly reasonable AND inevitable
- Must ALSO be surprising

**Pro Tip**: Mix causal and coincidental throughout story

---

### Commandment 2: Progressive Complications

**Definition**: Escalating degrees of conflict, increasing difficulty that forces larger risks.

**Critical Rule**: Cannot have protagonist face same dilemma in Act 3 that was faced in Act 1.

**Reversibility Factor Test** (Scale 1-10):
- 1 = Easy to reverse decision
- 10 = Absolutely irreversible

**Point of No Return**: Moment where character will never be same regardless of choice.

**Evaluation Method**: Track difficulty numbers (1-10) from beginning to end. Should show clear escalation pattern.

#### Turning Points (Sub-element)

**Definition**: Moment when new information comes to fore and character must react.

**Two ONLY Methods**:
| Method | Definition | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Character Action | Physical motion showing internal shift | Bill Murray swatting invisible fly (Tootsie) |
| Revelation | New information revealed | Chinatown - Gardener reveals saltwater in pool |

**Critical Balance**:
- All action = "Overly plotted"
- All revelation = "Melodramatic"
- Mix for best results

---

### Commandment 3: Crisis

**Definition**: A question offering choice between two options with no good answer.

**Two Types**:
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Best Bad Choice | Both options lead to negative outcomes | Choosing between two losses |
| Irreconcilable Goods | Both options lead to positive outcomes, but choosing one loses the other | Clarice: save woman OR keep devil out of mind |

**Key Characteristic**: Whatever choice made, character loses something.

---

### Commandment 4: Climax

**Definition**: The active choice protagonist makes in response to crisis.

**Principle**: Climax must be earned through progressive complications.

**Resolution vs Climax**:
- Climax = When character makes active choice determining outcome
- Resolution = What that climax MEANS to character

---

### Commandment 5: Resolution

**Definition**: The fallout from climax AND what it MEANS to the character.

**Critical Principle**: Shows how worldview has shifted. Not a recap - a revelation of meaning.

**Common Mistakes**:
- Dashing off in epilogues
- One/two sentence updates
- Summing up what already happened

---

## 4. Value Spectrums

**Structure**:
1. **Positive Pole**: Desired state
2. **Negative Pole**: Undesired state
3. **Negation of Negation**: Worst state (far worse than simple negative)

### Genre-Specific Value Spectrums

| Genre | Positive | Negative | Negation of Negation |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Action | Life | Death | Fate Worse Than Death |
| Horror | Life | Death | Damnation |
| Thriller | Life | Death | Damnation (internal) |
| Crime | Justice | Injustice | Corruption of Justice |
| Western | Civilization/Strong/Good | Wilderness/Weak/Evil | - |
| War | Victory/Honor | Defeat/Disgrace | - |
| Love | Love | Hate | Obsessive Destruction |

**Scene Value Turns**:
- Positive → Negative
- Negative → Positive
- Negative → Double Negative (worse)
- Positive → Double Positive (greater)

---

## 5. Story Structure Mathematics

### Story Proportions (25/50/25 Rule)

| Section | Percentage | Word Count (100k novel) | Scene Count |
|---------|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Beginning Hook | 25% | 20,000-25,000 | 12-13 |
| Middle Build | 50% | 40,000-50,000 | 25 |
| Ending Payoff | 25% | 20,000-25,000 | 12-13 |
| **Total** | 100% | 80,000-100,000 | ~50 |

### Scene Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Optimal scene length | 2,000 words |
| Acceptable range | 1,000-5,000 words |
| Minimum core scenes | 15 (5 per section) |
| Total scenes (100k novel) | ~50 |

### Kubler-Ross Change Curve Mapping

| Stage | Story Section | Function |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Shock + Denial | Beginning Hook | Initial disturbance, pretend normalcy |
| Anger + Bargaining | Middle Build (early) | Lash out, search for easy way out |
| Depression + Deliberation | Middle Build (late) | Bottom out, weigh options |
| Choice | Ending Payoff (climax) | Active decision |
| Acceptance | Ending Payoff (resolution) | New reality accepted |

---

## 6. Story Units Hierarchy

| Unit | Definition | Scope |
|------|------------|-------|
| Beat | Smallest identifiable moment of change | Moment-to-moment character choices |
| Scene | Basic building block with clear value shift | Must have all Five Commandments |
| Sequence | Group of scenes building toward larger turning point | Multiple scenes with cumulative progression |
| Act | Major structural division | Less important than Hook/Build/Payoff |
| Subplot | Secondary storyline parallel to global story | Often carries Internal Genre |
| Global Story | Entire narrative arc | Contains all other units |

**Critical Rule**: Every unit at every level must have all Five Commandments.

---

## 7. Obligatory Scenes & Conventions

### Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Convention | Expected scene type readers anticipate (can be subverted brilliantly) |
| Obligatory Scene | Scene absolutely necessary for story to work (cannot be omitted) |

### Genre-Specific Obligatory Scenes

| Genre | Obligatory Scene(s) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Action | Hero at the mercy of villain |
| Horror | Monster attack (inciting); Ultimate confrontation (climax) |
| Thriller | Hero at mercy of villain; Protagonist revealed as victim |
| Murder Mystery | Discovery of body (inciting); Revelation of murderer (climax) |
| Love | Lovers meet (inciting); Resolution of "do they stay together?" |

---

## 8. Controlling Idea / Theme

**Definition**: The takeaway message the writer wants the reader to discover.

### Three Requirements (per Robert McKee)

1. **Brevity**: Cannot exceed one-sentence statement
2. **Climactic value charge**: Must address final value shift
3. **Cause specificity**: Must explain WHY value shifts, not just that it does

### Formula Structure

`[Character trait/action] + [Value shift] = [Consequence/Meaning]`

### Examples

| Story | Controlling Idea |
|-------|-----------------|
| The Firm | "Justice prevails when an everyman victim is more clever than the criminals" |
| The Shining | "Narcissistic self-abuse annihilates all forms of human love" |
| Silence of the Lambs | "Disillusionment comes from discovering fundamental corruption in systems you trusted" |

---

## 9. Foolscap Global Story Grid Method

**Definition**: One-page planning document for systematic story analysis.

### Top Section: Global Elements
- Genre (External + Internal)
- Point of View character
- Controlling Idea/Theme
- Object of Desire (conscious)
- Object of Desire (subconscious)

### Bottom Section: Three-Part Scene Breakdown

Each section contains 5 core scenes:
1. Inciting Incident
2. Progressive Complication
3. Crisis
4. Climax
5. Resolution

### Tracking Rows
- Scene number/chapter
- POV character
- Scene value (what life value shifts)
- External/Internal genre progression
- Turning point method (action vs. revelation)

---

## 10. Genre Blending Rules

### Innovation Principles

1. **Know the form first** - Master conventions before breaking them
2. **Break brilliantly** - Subvert deliberately, not negligently
3. **Fulfill expectations** - Even when innovative

### Successful Blend Examples

| Blend | Components | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Thriller | Action + Horror + Crime | The Silence of the Lambs |
| Crime + Redemption | External crime + Internal redemption | The Verdict |
| War + Love | External war + Internal love | Atonement |
| Literary Horror | Horror + deep internal controlling idea | The Shining |

---

## 11. Quality Verification Checklist

### Story Works When:
- [ ] Readers finish and want to recommend
- [ ] Scenes have clear value shifts
- [ ] Progressive complications genuinely escalate
- [ ] Obligatory scenes present and earned
- [ ] Controlling idea evident
- [ ] Resolution shows changed worldview
- [ ] Climax flows inevitably yet surprisingly

### Story Fails When:
- [ ] Weak or absent Inciting Incident
- [ ] Flat progressive complications (same dilemma repeated)
- [ ] Missing obligatory scenes
- [ ] Soft climax that doesn't earn resolution
- [ ] No clear controlling idea
- [ ] Scenes don't turn (no value shift)
- [ ] Protagonist can easily reverse decisions

---

## 12. Implementation Notes for Narrative Generation

### Data Structure Priorities

1. **Genre classification** - Determines conventions/obligatory scenes
2. **Value spectrum tracking** - Shows story progression
3. **Inciting Incident architecture** - Opens every unit level
4. **Progressive complication engine** - Escalates difficulty (1-10 scale)
5. **Crisis/climax logic** - Decision based on objects of desire
6. **Resolution mapping** - Connects climax to worldview change

### Critical Checkpoints

- Every scene must have all Five Commandments
- Complications must escalate (track 1-10 scale)
- Turning points must alternate action/revelation
- Obligatory scenes must be present for chosen genre
- Controlling idea must thread through all decisions

## Four Core Framework

Each genre has four core elements that define its essential nature:

| Element | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Core Need** | The human need the genre satisfies |
| **Core Emotion** | The primary emotional experience for the audience |
| **Core Event** | The obligatory climactic moment |
| **Core Value** | The value spectrum at stake |

### Core Framework by Genre

| Genre | Core Need | Core Emotion | Core Event | Core Value |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Action** | Safety | Excitement | Hero at mercy of villain | Life vs. Death |
| **Horror** | Safety | Fear | Victim at mercy of monster | Life vs. Fate Worse Than Death |
| **Crime** | Justice | Intrigue | Exposure of criminal | Justice vs. Injustice |
| **Thriller** | Safety | Anxiety/Dread | Hero at mercy of villain | Life vs. Fate Worse Than Death |

| **Morality** | Redemption | Moral conflict | Choice between good and evil | Good vs. Evil |
| **Status** | Worth | Self-worth | Status achieved/lost | Success vs. Failure |

---

## Value Spectrums

> "Every story is a negotiation of values. The more finely you understand the value spectrum, the more nuanced your story can be."

### The Four-Stage Value Spectrum

Each core value has a four-stage progression:

1. **Positive** - The ideal state
2. **Contrary** - A less-than-ideal state (but not terrible)
3. **Negative** - The bad state
4. **Negation of the Negation** - Fate worse than the negative

### Value Spectrums by Genre

| Genre | Positive | Contrary | Negative | Negation of Negation |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Action/Thriller** | Life | Unconsciousness | Death | Damnation (fate worse than death) |
| **Crime** | Justice | Unfairness | Injustice | Tyranny |
| **Love** | Love | Desire | Indifference | Hate/Self-hatred |
| **Morality** | Good | Wavering | Indifference | Evil |
| **Status** | Success | Compromise | Failure | Selling out |
| **Worldview** | Meaning | Doubt | Meaninglessness | Nihilism |

### Key Principle

> "The negation of the negation is critical. It's not enough to simply go to the negative value. To create a truly powerful climax, you must threaten or achieve the negation of the negation - the absolute worst state."

---

## Five Commandments of Storytelling

> "Every unit of story - from the global story down to the individual scene - must contain all Five Commandments."

### 1. Inciting Incident

> "The Inciting Incident is the event that upsets the life balance of your protagonist. It's the Big Bang that creates the universe of your story."

**Two Types**:

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Causal** | Caused by another character's deliberate action | Crawford assigns Starling to interview Lecter |
| **Coincidental** | Random event/chance occurrence | Discovering a dead body by accident |

**Key Rule**: The Inciting Incident must be specific enough to hook the audience and create an immediate question.

### 2. Progressive Complications

> "Progressive Complications are the forces of antagonism that make it harder and harder for the protagonist to get what they want."

**The Turning Point** - Every sequence of progressive complications builds to a turning point that creates the crisis.

**Two Types of Turning Points**:

| Type | Definition | Effect |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Active** | A character takes action that changes the story | Protagonist discovers the killer's identity |
| **Revelatory** | Information is revealed that changes everything | Protagonist learns a secret about themselves |

### 3. Crisis

> "The Crisis is the dilemma the protagonist must face. It's an active question, not a passive state."

**Two Types of Crisis**:

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Best Bad Choice** | Two negative options, must choose lesser evil | Save one person or many (both have costs) |
| **Irreconcilable Goods** | Two positive options, can only choose one | Love vs. duty (both are good, can't have both) |

**Key Principle**: The crisis must be a genuine dilemma. If the choice is obvious, there is no drama.

### 4. Climax

> "The Climax is the active choice the protagonist makes in response to the crisis. It must be a decision followed by action."

**Requirements**:
- Must be an irreversible action
- Must demonstrate character (who they are under pressure)
- Must resolve the crisis question
- Must shift values (positive to negative or vice versa)

### 5. Resolution

> "The Resolution shows the new state of affairs after the climactic action. It tells the reader what the climax MEANS."

**Key Principle**:
> "Another trick to keep in mind is if your global Story rests on a massive internal shift in your lead character, the resolution scene should resolve the external changes in that character. If your maturation plot is the global Story climax, the resolution scene should revolve around a subplot External Genre. Likewise, if your global Story rests on a massive external shift like WAR, then the resolution scene should resolve the internal changes in your character."

## Story Structure

### The 25/50/25 Principle

> "The Beginning Hook comprises approximately 25% of the story, the Middle Build 50%, and the Ending Payoff 25%."

| Section | Percentage | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Beginning Hook** | ~25% | Setup, inciting incident, first major turn |
| **Middle Build** | ~50% | Progressive complications, point of no return |
| **Ending Payoff** | ~25% | Crisis, climax, resolution |

### Word Count Guidelines

| Story Type | Total Words | Beginning Hook | Middle Build | Ending Payoff |
|------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Novel** | 80,000-100,000 | 20,000-25,000 | 40,000-50,000 | 20,000-25,000 |
| **Short Story** | 2,000-7,500 | 500-1,875 | 1,000-3,750 | 500-1,875 |

### Scene Count Guidelines

> "A novel of 100,000 words will have approximately 50 scenes, with each scene averaging 2,000 words."

| Section | Scene Count (for 50-scene novel) |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Beginning Hook** | 12-13 scenes |
| **Middle Build** | 25 scenes |
| **Ending Payoff** | 12-13 scenes |

### The Silence of the Lambs - Actual Distribution

### Thriller Genre Conventions

|------------|-------------|---------|
| **MacGuffin** | The "why" behind the antagonist's actions | Buffalo Bill wants to make a "woman suit" |
| **Red Herring** | False lead that misdirects | Lecter's "Billy Rubin" deception |

---

## Controlling Idea / Theme

> "The Controlling Idea is a single sentence that expresses your story's ultimate meaning. It's the argument your story is making about life."

### The Formula

**Structure**: [VALUE] + [CAUSE]

> "[VALUE] is achieved/lost when/because [CAUSE]."

### Examples

| Story | Controlling Idea |
|-------|------------------|
| **The Silence of the Lambs** | Justice prevails when the protagonist is willing to sacrifice her career and psychological well-being to save an innocent life |
| **Romeo and Juliet** | Love destroys when it defies social order |
| **The Godfather** | Power corrupts when family loyalty supersedes morality |

### Types by Ending

| Ending Type | Value Direction | Example |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Prescriptive (Positive)** | Positive value achieved | "Justice prevails when..." |
| **Cautionary (Negative)** | Negative value results | "Corruption triumphs when..." |
| **Ironic** | Mixed/ambiguous result | External positive, internal negative |

### Silence of the Lambs - Ironic Ending

> "While Starling's external Genre has moved from negative to positive (she saved Catherine Martin and killed Buffalo Bill), her internal worldview has moved from positive (blind belief in the FBI) to negative (disillusionment). This creates an ironic ending - she's won externally but lost internally."

## Scene Analysis Framework

### Story Grid Spreadsheet

> "The Story Grid Spreadsheet is a tool to analyze every scene in your manuscript."

### Spreadsheet Columns

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Scene Number** | Sequential numbering |
| **Word Count** | Length of scene |
| **Story Event** | What happens (shortest possible description) |
| **Value Shift** | From X to Y (e.g., Life to Death, Love to Indifference) |
| **Polarity Shift** | + to - or - to + |
| **Turning Point Type** | Active or Revelatory |
| **POV** | Whose perspective |
| **Period/Time** | When it occurs |
| **Duration** | How long in story time |
| **Location** | Where it occurs |

### Scene Requirements

> "Every scene must turn. That is, it must shift values. A scene that doesn't turn is not a scene - it's exposition."

**Scene Must Have**:
1. Clear beginning, middle, end
2. Value shift (polarity change)
3. At least one of the Five Commandments clearly present
4. Contribute to overall story progression

### The Editor's Approach

> "FINDING THE PROBLEMS IS THE EDITOR'S #1 JOB. This first draft spreadsheet round is all about finding the problems. It's not about solving the problems."

> "The last thing you want to do is lie to yourself about what is actually on the page. You need to remind yourself that you are going to fix the problems in due course. This is the time to find the problems, not to sweep them under the rug."

## Kubler-Ross Change Curve Application

### The Five Stages Applied to Story

Coyne applies the Kubler-Ross grief/change model to story structure:

| Stage | Story Application | Typical Location |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Denial** | Character refuses to accept new reality | Beginning Hook |
| **Anger** | Character rages against circumstances | Early Middle Build |
| **Bargaining** | Character attempts to negotiate/avoid | Mid Middle Build |
| **Depression** | "All Is Lost" moment | Late Middle Build |
| **Acceptance** | Character accepts and acts | Ending Payoff |

### Key Insight

> "The protagonist must go through a complete internal change arc that mirrors the external plot progression. The 'All Is Lost' moment (depression) typically comes at the midpoint, not the end."

---

## Additional Frameworks and Tools

### The Point of No Return

> "The Point of No Return is the moment when the protagonist can no longer go back to their ordinary world. They are committed to the journey."

**Location**: Typically at the midpoint of the story (end of first half of Middle Build)

**Requirements**:
- Must be an irreversible action or choice
- Stakes must be clear
- Creates urgency for remainder of story

### Protagonist vs. Antagonist

> "The protagonist and the antagonist are polar expressions of a single archetype. What separates them is often a single choice or capability."

**Example from Silence of the Lambs**:
> "What separates Buffalo Bill and Clarice Starling, both abandoned children with deep-seated anger, is the ability to confront their inner demons. Buffalo Bill is incapable of doing so. Instead he decides he must literally change himself. But Starling is capable of confronting her inner demons and she does so with Lecter as her guide."

### Object of Desire - Dual Layer

| Layer | Definition | Silence of the Lambs Example |
|-------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Conscious** | What the character says/thinks they want | Starling wants to be a respected FBI agent |
| **Unconscious** | What the character actually needs | Starling needs to confront her childhood trauma and accept herself |

### The "It's Personal" Requirement

> "You must make the case personal to your protagonist. This doesn't mean the antagonist has to have a personal beef with them - it means the stakes must become personally meaningful."

**Innovative Approach** (from Silence of the Lambs):
> "Harris has taken a rather tired convention 'make it personal,' turned it on its ear, and made it a seamless and inevitable progressive complication. The case becomes personal to Starling not because Buffalo Bill targets her, but because her career, her psychological stability, and her sense of self are all at stake."

---

## Key Principles and Quotes

### On Genre Mastery

> "If you want your Story to be great, you've got to hone it and edit it yourself."

### On The Story Grid Purpose

> "The Story Grid is all about getting from 'Doesn't Work' to 'Works' to 'Holy Moly This is Incredible!'"

### On Story vs. Formula

> "The Story Grid is a tool. It is not a formula. You cannot just plug a bunch of stuff into The Foolscap Global Story Grid or The Story Grid Spreadsheet and then diagram it out in the final Story Grid and voila have a terrific book come out at the end."

### On The Editor's Role

> "The inescapable fact is that you need an editor who cares about making your book not just 'work' but for it to transcend its Genre...to break new ground in such a way that it changes the way people see the world. And there is only one editor alive with that kind of commitment. You."

### On Innovation Within Genre

> "You look at [conventions and obligatory scenes] in a different way than just a checklist of things you have to cram into your Story. You look at them as opportunities to elevate your Story."

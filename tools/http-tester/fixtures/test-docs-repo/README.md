# Test Documentation Repository

This is a test repository for validating the Documentation Service git repository binding functionality.

It contains various markdown files with different frontmatter patterns to test:
- Full frontmatter with all fields
- Minimal frontmatter
- No frontmatter (title extraction from content)
- Draft documents (excluded by default)
- Category mapping by directory structure

# Exceptions:
#   - sdks/core/ contains shared types (BaseServiceEvent, etc.) needed by bannou-service
#   - sdks/bundle-format/ needed by lib-asset for bundle reading/writing
#   - sdks/music-theory/ needed by lib-music for music generation
#   - sdks/music-storyteller/ needed by lib-music for narrative-driven composition

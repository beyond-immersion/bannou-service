# Test Configuration - Shared settings for all test scenarios
# This file provides common test environment overrides
# Stack with specific test files: test.infrastructure, test.http, or test.edge
#
# NOTE: Application configuration (ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT, credentials, feature flags)
# belongs in .env.test.* files, NOT here. Docker Compose 'environment:' overrides 'env_file:',
# so hardcoding values here silently ignores the env file settings.

  # Bannou test configuration overrides

    # All application configuration comes from env_file in specific test compose files
    # (test.infrastructure, test.http, test.edge each set their own env_file)
    # Do NOT add environment variables here - they override env_file values

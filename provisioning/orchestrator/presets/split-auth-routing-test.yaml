# Split Service Routing Test Preset
# Tests dynamic service-to-app-id routing with auth/accounts on separate node
# This validates the core multi-node routing architecture
#
# Topology:
# - bannou-main: connect, permissions, game-session, behavior, orchestrator, testing
# - bannou-auth: accounts, auth
#
# When deployed, ServiceMappingEvents are published:
# - accounts -> bannou-auth
# - auth -> bannou-auth
# - connect -> bannou-main
# - permissions -> bannou-main
# - etc.
#
# The ServiceAppMappingResolver receives these events and routes accordingly.

# Split Service Routing Test Preset
# Tests dynamic service-to-app-id routing with auth/accounts on separate node
# This validates the core multi-node routing architecture
#
# Topology:
# - Main node (already running): connect, permissions, game-session, behavior, orchestrator, etc.
# - bannou-auth (deployed by this preset): accounts, auth
#
# NOTE: The main node is NOT included here - orchestrator never deploys itself.
# Presets only define ADDITIONAL nodes to deploy alongside the main orchestrator node.
#
# Environment Inheritance:
# Deployed containers inherit ALL environment variables from the orchestrator,
# so there's no need to duplicate AUTH_*, STATE_*, etc. configuration here.
# Only specify overrides or node-specific configuration.
#
# When deployed, ServiceMappingEvents are published:
# - accounts -> bannou-auth
# - auth -> bannou-auth
#
# The ServiceAppMappingResolver receives these events and routes accordingly.

# Dapr Subscriptions
# Note: Most subscriptions are handled via [Topic] attributes on controllers (programmatic subscriptions)
# This file is only needed for declarative subscriptions that can't use the attribute approach
# See: https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/subscription-methods/
